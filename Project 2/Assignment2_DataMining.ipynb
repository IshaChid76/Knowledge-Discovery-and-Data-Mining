            "The apparition comes.\n",
            "These hands are not more like.\n",
            "But where was this?\n",

            "My lord, I did, But answer made it none.\n",
            "But even then the morning cock crew loud, And at the sound it shrunk in haste away And vanished from our sight.\n",
            "Tis very strange.\n",
            "As I do live, my honored lord, 'tis true.\n",
            "And we did think it writ down in our duty To let you know of it.\n",

            "He may not, as unvalued persons do, Carve for himself, for on his choice depends The safety and the health of this whole state.\n",
            "And therefore must his choice be circumscribed Unto the voice and yielding of that body Whereof he is the head.\n",
            "Then, if he says he loves you, It fits your wisdom so far to believe it As he in his particular act and place May give his saying deed, which is no further Than the main voice of Denmark goes withal.\n",

            "In few, Ophelia, Do not believe his vows, for they are brokers, Not of that dye which their investments show, But mere implorators of unholy suits, Breathing like sanctified and pious bawds The better to beguile.\n",
            "I would not, in plain terms, from this time forth Have you so slander any moment leisure As to give words or talk with the Lord Hamlet.\n",

            "Is it a custom?\n",
            "Ay, marry, is 't, But, to my mind, though I am native here And to the manner born, it is a custom More honored in the breach than the observance.\n",
            "Makes us traduced and taxed of other nations.\n",
            "They clepe us drunkards and with swinish phrase Soil our addition.\n",

            "Carrying, I say, the stamp of one defect, Being nature's livery or fortune's star, His virtues else, be they as pure as grace, As infinite as man may undergo, Shall in the general censure take corruption From that particular fault.\n",

            "Wherein we saw thee quietly interred, Hath oped his ponderous and marble jaws To cast thee up again.\n",
            "What may this mean That thou, dead corse, again in complete steel, Revisits thus the glimpses of the moon, Making night hideous, and we fools of nature So horridly to shake our disposition With thoughts beyond the reaches of our souls?\n",
            "Say, why is this?\n",
            "Wherefore?\n",

            "And for my soul, what can it do to that, Being a thing immortal as itself?\n",
            "It waves me forth again.\n",

            "Or to the dreadful summit of the cliff That beetles o'er his base into the sea, And there assume some other horrible form Which might deprive your sovereignty of reason And draw you into madness?\n",
            "Think of it.\n",
            "The very place puts toys of desperation, Without more motive, into every brain That looks so many fathoms to the sea And hears it roar beneath.\n",
            "It waves me still.\n",
            "Go on, I'll follow thee.\n",

            "I am thy father's spirit, Doomed for a certain term to walk the night And for the day confined to fast in fires Till the foul crimes done in my days of nature Are burnt and purged away.\n",
            "But that I am forbid To tell the secrets of my prison house, I could a tale unfold whose lightest word Would harrow up thy soul, freeze thy young blood, Make thy two eyes, like stars, start from their spheres, Thy knotted and combined locks to part, And each particular hair to stand an end, Like quills upon the fearful porpentine.\n",
            "But this eternal blazon must not be To ears of flesh and blood.\n",
            "List, list, O list!\n",

            "Haste me to know 't, that I, with wings as swift As meditation or the thoughts of love, May sweep to my revenge.\n",
            "And duller shouldst thou be than the fat weed That roots itself in ease on Lethe wharf, Wouldst thou not stir in this.\n",
            "Now, Hamlet, hear.\n",
            "Tis given out that, sleeping in my orchard, A serpent stung me.\n",
            "So the whole ear of Denmark Is by a forged process of my death Rankly abused.\n",

            "My uncle!\n",
            "O wicked wit and gifts, that have the power So to seduce!\n",
            "Hamlet, what a falling off was there!\n",
            "From me, whose love was of that dignity That it went hand in hand even with the vow I made to her in marriage, and to decline Upon a wretch whose natural gifts were poor To those of mine.\n",
            "But virtue, as it never will be moved, Though lewdness court it in a shape of heaven, So, lust, though to a radiant angel linked, Will sate itself in a celestial bed And prey on garbage.\n",
            "But soft, methinks I scent the morning air.\n",
            "Brief let me be.\n",
            "Sleeping within my orchard, My custom always of the afternoon, Upon my secure hour thy uncle stole With juice of cursed hebona in a vial And in the porches of my ears did pour The leprous distilment, whose effect Holds such an enmity with blood of man That swift as quicksilver it courses through The natural gates and alleys of the body, And with a sudden vigor it doth posset And curd, like eager droppings into milk, The thin and wholesome blood.\n",
            "All my smooth body.\n",
            "Thus was I, sleeping, by a brother's hand Of life, of crown, of queen at once dispatched, Cut off, even in the blossoms of my sin, Unhouseled, disappointed, unaneled, No reck'ning made, but sent to my account With all my imperfections on my head.\n",
            "O horrible, O horrible, most horrible!\n",
            "If thou hast nature in thee, bear it not.\n",
            "Let not the royal bed of Denmark be A couch for luxury and damned incest.\n",
            "But, howsomever thou pursues this act, Taint not thy mind, nor let thy soul contrive Against thy mother aught.\n",

            "Remember thee?\n",
            "Yea, from the table of my memory I'll wipe away all trivial, fond records, All saws of books, all forms, all pressures past, That youth and observation copied there, And thy commandment all alone shall live Within the book and volume of my brain, Unmixed with baser matter.\n",
            "Yes, by heaven!\n",
            "O most pernicious woman!\n",
            "O villain, villain, smiling, damned villain!\n",
            "I set it down That one may smile and smile and be a villain.\n",
